# Nextjs Support

Vulcan supports Nextjs in compute and deliver modes.

## Deliver

Static site delivered by edge without a function.
Check static examples in [Nextjs examples dir](/examples//next/) for more details.

## Compute

In compute mode the nextjs handler uses a routing system (based on vercel multiple steps routing) to handle the request.

After a route match in the routing system takes one of these actions:

- deliver a static;
- make a request override;
- call a builded edge module;
- call a node custom server;

This solution was created based on fastly ([next-compute-js v1](https://github.com/fastly/next-compute-js)) and cloudflare ([next-on-pages](https://github.com/cloudflare/next-on-pages)) Nextjs solutions.
